# Todo CLI (Go)

A tiny command-line todo app I’m building to learn Go through project-based learning. The goal is to keep it simple, use the standard library mostly, and level it up over time (with persistence, additional commands, tests, and improved UX).

## What it does (so far)
- Add tasks from the terminal
- List tasks with an ID and checkbox-style status

## Why I made this
I wanted a small project that forces me to practice the Go fundamentals that actually matter:
modules, packages, error handling, file I/O, and eventually testing + concurrency patterns.

## Getting started

### Prereqs
- Go installed (1.20+ recommended)

### Run locally
Clone the repo and run:
```bash
go run ./cmd/todo
